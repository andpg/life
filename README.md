# Game of Life

I made Conway's Game of Life in Raylib.

It's actually my first project in C! The code probably has too many unnecessary variables or is badly structured, but part of my recovery is stabbing unnecessary shame, slicing its liver and marking the doors of my home with its blood, so I will let people see my imperfect code. The algorithm was pretty easy because I stored the state in a looooong array of bools. It's probably the most efficient way, bar malloc. It didn't feel like the right moment to use malloc though.

Make with `make` (`gcc` needed).
